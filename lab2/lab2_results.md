1. **When would you choose zero-shot?**

- It is good for simple questions, when you don't need a specific formated answer.

2. **When is few-shot worth the extra effort?**
- When you need a more detailed answer or a formated answer. For example the @few_shot_codegen.py, when the example were taken off it would return very long answers instead of just correct and to the point. (like the examples provided)

3.  **How did the classification output change from Task 3.11 Task 3.12**
    - 3.11 task: it classified most of them correctly.
    - 3.12 task: A few of the classification where wrong because of our examples being wrong.

4. **How did the generated code change from Task 3.21 to Task 3.22?**
    - 3.21 task: It was able to output answers in a similar format as to what was in the examples.
    - 3.22 task: It still provided functions that seemed correct, however they were lengthy and the format differed than what was in the deleted examples.
